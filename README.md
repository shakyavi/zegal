## DESCRIPTION 
This repository contains code to simulate a high-volume data input environment. It basically has four major components:
- A Message Queue (RabbitMQ)
- NodeJs backend to publish messages
- NodeJs backend to subscribe and filter out messages and send to front end via Socket.IO
- A React Frontend app to diplay messages via Socket.io

Message Format
```
{
  message: <random text>,
  timestamp: <timestamp>,
  priority: <random number from 1-10>
}
```
## ARCHITECTURE & DESIGN
The project consists of three major modules:
- producer
- consumer
- frontend

### producer module
The producer module is based on NodeJs with Express framework. Express initializes the application as function which is passed to the HTTP server. The http server listens on port 3001. The `sender.js` file initializes the backend server along with creating connections with two major services :
- `RabbitMQ`
- `Socket.IO` 

#### RabbitMQ Service
The `sender.js` file establishes a new connection with the `RabbitMQ` service and creates new channel. Two queues are used in this application for messaging:
- `zegalDemo` : Stores all the messages generated by our `producer` or the `sender.js` file
- `zegalDemoFiltered` : Stores the messages filtered by our `consumer` or `receiver.js` for displaying in the front-end

The consume logic for the `zegalDemoFiltered` queue is also setup, after creating the rabbitMQ channel. This  event consumes the messages pushed to `zegalDemoFiltered` queue and emits `consumerResponse` event to the socket connection.

#### Socket.IO
The `sender.js` file also starts a socket connection based on the http server instance. On successful connection, a listener for `messageFromApp` is setup on the socket, which in turn invokes the `pushMessageToQueue` method. This method, starts publishing messages to the `zegalDemo` queue.

### consumer module
The consumer module, like the producer is based on NodeJs and Express framework. The http server is initialized and it also uses the `RabbitMQ` and `Socket.IO` connections to receive the queue messages and filter them by priority.

### frontend module
